                            <strong>No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just
                                like Christmas and Easter.</strong> It belongs to everyone. Do not believe the claims of
                            businesses
                            who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the
                            term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do
                            not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras.
                            Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the
                            country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true
                            in New Orleans.

                                continue
                                going to every parade because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring
                                big
                                bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often
                                include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.</P>
                            <P>The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size
                                parades
                                pass anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near
                                Napoleon since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden
                                District
                                portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking out
                                their
                                parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the
                                beautiful
                                oak trees. You don't have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this
                                area
                                during Mardi Gras.</P>
                            <P>You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like
                                Metairie, which is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the
                                Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras
                                day.
                                Kids love it!</P>
