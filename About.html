                        <p>The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3
                            and
                            March 9 (depending on the date of Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday).</p>
                        <p>In New Orleans, the Zulu parade rolls first, starting at 8 am on the corner of Jackson and
                            Claiborne and ending at Broad and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St. Charles
                            following the traditional Uptown route from Napoleon to St. Charles and then to Canal St.
                            Truck parades follow Rex and often have hundreds of floats blowing loud horns, with entire
                            families riding and throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons.
                            Numerous smaller parades and walking clubs also parade around the city. The Jefferson City
                            Buzzards, the Lyons Club, the Irish Channel Corner Club, Pete Fountain's Half Fast Walking
                            Club and the KOE all start early in the day Uptown and make their way to the French Quarter
                            with at least one jazz band. At the other end of the old city, the Society of Saint Anne
                            journeys from the Bywater through Marigny and the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal
                            Street. The Pair-O-Dice Tumblers rambles from bar to bar in Marigny and the French Quarter
                            from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras Indians, divided into uptown and downtown
                            tribes, parade in their finery.

                            <p>The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany,
                                also called Twelfth Night or Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading
                                up to the big event.</p>
                            <p>Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day.
                                Our private Carnival clubs, called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads,
                                doubloons and toys to parade goers. Visitors quickly learn to say, "Throw me something
                                mister!"</p>
                            <p>The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu
                                Social Aid & Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food
                                and elaborate costumes add to the fun-filled day of excitement for revelers of all ages.

                            <p>New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an
                                exciting place to be at any time of the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi
                                Gras at least once in their lifetime. Make your plans now to be a part of this great

                            The population of New Orleans more than doubles during the five days before Mardi
                            Gras
                            Day,
                            in anticipation of the biggest celebration.</p>

                        <p>Wednesday night begins with Druids, and is followed by the Mystic Krewe of Nyx, the
                            newest
                            all-female Krewe. Nyx is famous for their highly decorated purses, and has reached
                            Super
                            Krewe status since their founding in 2011. Nyx has plummeted in membership and can
                            no
                            longer
                            hold their self proclaimed status as a super krewe.

                            Thursday night starts off with another all-women's parade featuring the Krewe of
                            Muses.
                            The
                            parade is relatively new, but its membership has tripled since its start in 2001. It
                            is
                            popular for its throws (highly sought-after decorated shoes and other trinkets) and
                            themes
                            poking fun at politicians and celebrities.</p>
                        <p>Friday night is the occasion of the large Krewe of Hermes and satirical Krewe D'État
                            parades,
                            ending with one of the fastest-growing krewes, the Krewe of Morpheus.There are
                            several
                            smaller neighborhood parades like the Krewe of Barkus and the Krewe of OAK.</p>
                        <p>Several daytime parades roll on Saturday (including Krewe of Tucks and Krewe of Isis)
                            and
                            on
                            Sunday (Thoth, Okeanos, and Krewe of Mid-City).</p>
                        <p>The first of the "super krewes," Endymion, parades on Saturday night, with the
                            celebrity-led
                            Bacchus parade on Sunday night.</p>

                            In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe members on
                            the
                            days
                            before Fat Tuesday (other than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi Gras.
                            Laws
                            against concealing one's identity with a mask are suspended for the day. Banks are
                            closed,
                            and some businesses and other places with security concerns (such as convenience
                            stores)
                            post signs asking people to remove their masks before entering.</p>

                            The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple,
                            green,
                            and
                            gold. The colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization
                            during
                            the
                            lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in
                            banners of
                            these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts
                            suggest
                            that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to
                            any
                            true
                            symbolism.</p>
                        <p>Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization,
                            presented a
                            theory that the colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a
                            heraldic
                            tincture, and Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their
                            "kingdom".
                            Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was already heavily used on
                            other
                            national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green,
                            gold
                            and
                            purple in that order complies with the rule of tincture, which states that metals
                            (gold
                            or
                            silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and that colors cannot be
                            placed
                            on
                            or next to other colors.</p>
                        <p>Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and
                            gold-colored
                            floats themed around the concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that
                            the
                            three colors in that order symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional
                            colors
                            are
